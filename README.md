# Artwork Generation using GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks):

Deep neural networks are used mainly for supervised learning: classification or regression. Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs, however, neural networks can be used for a very different purpose: Generative modeling

Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.

To get a sense of the power of generative models, just visit [thispersondoesnotexist.com](thispersondoesnotexist.com). Every time you reload the page, a new image of a person's face is generated on the fly. The results are pretty fascinating:

A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning frameworks and a prominent framework for approaching generative AI. The concept was initially developed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in June 2014. In a GAN, two neural networks contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game, where one agent's gain is another agent's loss.

There are two neural networks: a Generator and a Discriminator. The generator generates a "fake" sample given a random vector/matrix, and the discriminator attempts to detect whether a given sample is "real" (picked from the training data) or "fake" (generated by the generator). Training happens in tandem: we train the discriminator for a few epochs, then train the generator for a few epochs, and repeat. This way both the generator and the discriminator get better at doing their jobs.
